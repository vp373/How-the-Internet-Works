            <p>Web development refers to building, creating, and maintaining websites. It includes aspects such as web design, web publishing, web programming, and database management. While the terms "web developer" and "web designer" are often used synonymously, they do not mean the same thing. Technically, a web designer only designs website interfaces using HTML and CSS. A web developer may be involved in designing a website, but may also write web scripts in languages such as PHP and ASP. Additionally, a web developer may help maintain and update a database used by a dynamic website. Web development includes many types of web content creation. Some examples include hand coding web pages in a text editor, building a website in a program like Dreamweaver, and updating a blog via a blogging website. In recent years, content management systems like WordPress, Drupal, and Joomla have also become popular means of web development. These tools make it easy for anyone to create and edit their own website using a web-based interface. While there are several methods of creating websites, there is often a trade-off between simplicity and customization. Therefore, most large businesses do not use content management systems, but instead have a dedicated Web development team that designs and maintains the company's website(s). Small organizations and individuals are more likely to choose a solution like WordPress that provides a basic website template and simplified editing tools.</p>
            <h2>HTML</h2>
            <p>HTML Stands for "Hypertext Markup Language." HTML is the language used to create webpages. "Hypertext" refers to the hyperlinks that an HTML page may contain. "Markup language" refers to the way tags are used to define the page layout and elements within the page. Below is an example of HTML used to define a basic webpage with a title and a single paragraph of text.</p>
            <pre>&lt;!doctype html&gt;<br />&lt;html&gt;<br />&lt;head&gt;<br />&lt;title&gt;TechTerms.com&lt;/title&gt;<br />&lt;/head&gt;<br />&lt;body&gt;<br />&lt;p&gt;This is an example of a paragraph in HTML.&lt;/p&gt;<br />&lt;/body&gt;<br />&lt;/html&gt;</pre>
            <p>This is an example of a paragraph in HTML.</p>
            <p>The first line defines what type of contents the document contains. "" means the page is written in HTML5. Properly formatted HTML pages should include , , and tags, which are all included in the example above. The page title, metadata, and links to referenced files are placed between the tags. The actual contents of the page go between the tags. The web has gone through many changes over the past few decades, but HTML has always been the fundamental language used to develop webpages. Interestingly, while websites have become more advanced and interactive, HTML has actually gotten simpler. If you compare the source of an HTML5 page with a similar page written in HTML 4.01 or XHTML 1.0, the HTML5 page would probably contain less code. This is because modern HTML relies on cascading style sheets or JavaScript to format nearly all the elements within a page.</p>
            <h2>BOOTSTRAP</h2>
            <p>Bootstrap, or bootstrapping, is a verb that comes from the saying, "to pull oneself up by his bootstraps." The idiom implies a person is self sufficient, not requiring help from others. Similarly, in the computing world, bootstrapping describes a process that automatically loads and executes commands. The most fundamental form of bootstrapping is the startup process that takes place when you start up a computer. In fact, the term "boot," as in booting up a computer, comes from the word bootstrap. When you turn on or restart a computer, it automatically loads a sequence of commands that initializes the system, checks for hardware, and loads the operating system. This process does not require any user input and is therefore considered a bootstrap process. While bootstrapping is often associated with the system boot sequence, it can be used by individual applications as well. For example, a program may automatically run a series of commands when opened. These commands may process user settings, check for updates, and load dynamic libraries, such as DLL files. They are considered bootstrap processes because they run automatically as the program is starting up.</p>
